This soundfont is designed to leverage the multiple sample nature of the source set.

* Notes are mapped to the General Midi (GM) Drum map. Note numbers can be edited to taste in the section at the beginning of the file.
* TR-909.sfz outputs everything to a single stereo pair.
* TR-909-multi.sfz adds multiple outputs which are customizable in the file.
* In theory TR-909-multi.sfz should operate in single output players, which should ignore output numbers other than 0. In practice I've found that not always to be the case.
