# Roland TR-505 Drum Machine SFZ
Soundfont instrument for use with the free TR-505. Available as of this writing at http://machines.hyperreal.org/manufacturers/Roland/TR-505/. 

Samples are expected in a samples folder below the one containing the sfz file.
if not, edit or remove the default_path line below. 

See roland.tr-505.txt further info.

Level and panning controls for each sound, while not on the 505, are added here for convenience.

* Notes are mapped to the General Midi (GM) Drum map. Note numbers can be edited to taste in the section at the beginning of the file.
* TR-505.sfz outputs everything to a single stereo pair.
* TR-505-multi.sfz adds multiple outputs which are customizable in the file.
* In theory multiple output sfz's should operate in single output players, which should ignore output numbers other than 0. In practice I've found that not always to be the case.
