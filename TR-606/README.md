# Roland TR-606 Drumatix SFZ
Soundfont instrument for use with the free TR-606 samples available as of this writing at http://machines.hyperreal.org/manufacturers/Roland/TR-606/samples/tr606kit.zip. 

Samples are expected in a samples folder below the one containing the sfz file.
if not, edit or remove the default_path line below. 

See tr-606kit.txt further info.

Level and panning controls for each sound, while not on the 606, are added here for convenience.

* Notes are mapped to the General Midi (GM) Drum map. Note numbers can be edited to taste in the section at the beginning of the file.
* TR-606.sfz outputs everything to a single stereo pair.
* TR-606-multi.sfz adds multiple outputs which are customizable in the file.
* In theory multiple output sfz's should operate in single output players, which should ignore output numbers other than 0. In practice I've found that not always to be the case.
