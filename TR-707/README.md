# Roland TR-707 Drum Machine SFZ
Soundfont instrument for use with the free TR-707 samples available as of this writing at http://machines.hyperreal.org/manufacturers/Roland/TR-707/samples/tr707.zip. 

Samples are expected in a samples folder below the one containing the sfz file.
if not, edit or remove the default_path line below. 

See tr707.txt further info.

Panning controls for each sound, while not on the 606, are added here for convenience.

* Notes are mapped to the General Midi (GM) Drum map. Note numbers can be edited to taste in the section at the beginning of the file.
* TR-707.sfz outputs everything to a single stereo pair.
* TR-707-multi.sfz adds multiple outputs which are customizable in the file.
* In theory multiple output sfz's should operate in single output players, which should ignore output numbers other than 0. In practice I've found that not always to be the case.
