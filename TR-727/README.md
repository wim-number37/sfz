# Roland TR-727 Drum Machine SFZ
Soundfont instrument for use with the free TR-727 samples available as of this writing at http://machines.hyperreal.org/manufacturers/Roland/TR-727/. 

Samples are expected in a samples folder below the one containing the sfz file.
if not, edit or remove the default_path line below. 

Panning controls for each sound, while not on the 727, are added here for convenience.

* Notes are mapped to the General Midi (GM) Drum map. Note numbers can be edited to taste in the section at the beginning of the file. 
* TR-727.sfz outputs everything to a single stereo pair.
* TR-727-multi.sfz adds multiple outputs which are customizable in the file.
* In theory multiple output sfz's should operate in single output players, which should ignore output numbers other than 0. In practice I've found that not always to be the case.
* The LO BONGO.WAV file in the origional has a delay in it due to silence at the start of the file. The samples.zip version here has been fixed to remove the silence.
